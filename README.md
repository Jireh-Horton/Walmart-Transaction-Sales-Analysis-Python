# Walmart-Transaction-Sales-Analysis-Python

This repository includes the Python notebook I created for analyzing Walmart sales transactions, along with the CSV file used for the analysis. I discovered this data file here on GitHub. For this analysis, I approached it as if the client wanted me to look into their sales data. I answered several questions I believed the client might like to see, as well as producing a few graphs regarding total sales, average sales, and transaction volume by hour over a period of three months, including a 7-day and 30-day moving average.
